# Performance Comparison: scikit-learn vs MLCPP Linear Regression

This document compares the performance of scikit-learn's built-in LinearRegression implementation against the custom MLCPP LinearRegression implementation using the California Housing dataset.

## Dataset

The comparison uses the California Housing dataset with:
- 20,640 samples
- 8 features: MedInc, HouseAge, AveRooms, AveBedrms, Population, AveOccup, Latitude, Longitude
- Training set: 16,512 samples (80%)
- Test set: 4,128 samples (20%)

## Accuracy Comparison

| Metric | MLCPP | scikit-learn | Difference |
|--------|-------|-------------|------------|
| Mean Squared Error (MSE) | 0.555893 | 0.555892 | +0.000001 |
| RÂ² Score | 0.575787 | 0.575788 | -0.000001 |

The accuracy metrics show that both implementations achieve essentially identical performance, with negligible differences that could be attributed to floating-point precision or minor implementation details. This confirms that the MLCPP implementation correctly implements linear regression from a statistical perspective.

## Compute Time Comparison

| Operation | MLCPP | scikit-learn | Ratio (MLCPP/scikit-learn) |
|-----------|-------|-------------|----------------------------|
| Training time | 10.7090s | 0.0030s | 3598.51x |
| Prediction time | 0.0062s | 0.0081s | 0.76x |

### Analysis:

1. **Training Performance**: 
   - scikit-learn is significantly faster for training (approximately 3,600 times faster)
   - This large difference is likely due to scikit-learn using optimized matrix operations and a direct analytical solution for linear regression, while MLCPP uses an iterative gradient descent approach with 10,000 max iterations

2. **Prediction Performance**:
   - MLCPP is slightly faster for prediction (about 24% faster)
   - This advantage could be due to lower overhead in the C++ implementation when making predictions

## Model Coefficients

Both models produced nearly identical coefficients:

| Feature | MLCPP | scikit-learn |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| MedInc | 0.854393 | 0.854383 |
| HouseAge | 0.122548 | 0.122546 |
| AveRooms | -0.294428 | -0.294410 |
| AveBedrms | 0.339274 | 0.339259 |
| Population | -0.002307 | -0.002308 |
| AveOccup | -0.040830 | -0.040829 |
| Latitude | -0.896906 | -0.896929 |
| Longitude | -0.869820 | -0.869842 |
| Intercept | 2.071947 | 2.071947 |

## Conclusion

The MLCPP implementation achieves prediction accuracy that matches scikit-learn's implementation. While training is significantly slower due to the implementation method (gradient descent vs direct solution), the prediction speed is slightly better.

Potential improvements for MLCPP:
1. Implement a direct analytical solution for linear regression to improve training speed
2. Optimize the gradient descent implementation with vectorized operations
3. Explore parallel processing for large datasets

Overall, the MLCPP implementation demonstrates correctness and competitive prediction performance, although with room for improvement in training efficiency.
