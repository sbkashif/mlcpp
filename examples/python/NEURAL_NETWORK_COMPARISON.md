This document provides a detailed comparison between the neural network implementations in MLCPP and scikit-learn.

## Implementation Comparison

| Feature | MLCPP Neural Network | scikit-learn MLPClassifier |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Implementation Language | C++ with Python bindings | Python/Cython |
| Architecture | Fully connected feedforward | Fully connected feedforward |
| Hidden Layers | Customizable (any number) | Customizable (any number) |
| Activation Functions | Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh | identity, logistic, tanh, relu |
| Optimization | Mini-batch gradient descent | SGD, Adam, L-BFGS |
| Weight Initialization | Xavier/Glorot | Xavier/Glorot |
| Regularization | None | L2 regularization, early stopping |
| Learning Rate | Fixed | Constant, adaptive, invscaling |

## Performance Metrics

The following performance metrics were collected using the moons dataset (1000 samples) with identical network architectures (2 hidden layers with 8 neurons each):

| Metric | MLCPP Neural Network | scikit-learn MLPClassifier | Ratio (MLCPP/scikit-learn) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| Training Time | 6.76 seconds | 0.17 seconds | 40.68x slower |
| Accuracy | 95.67% | 96.33% | 0.99x (99% as accurate) |
| Memory Usage | Lower | Higher | ~0.6x |

## XOR Problem Performance

The XOR problem is a classic non-linearly separable problem that requires a neural network with at least one hidden layer.

| Activation Function | MLCPP Accuracy | Convergence Speed |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Sigmoid | 75% | ~200-300 iterations |
| ReLU | 75% | ~120 iterations |
| Tanh | 100% | ~5800 iterations |
